## Description

AstroTrek is a star gazing app that allows users to record observations or visits and create their own database of astronomical objects or bodies that they wish to observe.

---

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- GitHub
- Heroku
- React
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Express

## Getting Started

Start off by creating an account. If a user does not have an account, they can view everyone else's astronomical objects.

Once a user is signed in, they can add, edit, view and delete astronomical objects and stargazing visits or observations.

The search weather section allows a user to view the weather conditions for the evening of their observation.
